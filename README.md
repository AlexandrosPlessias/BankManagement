# BankManagement
In my implementation, the bank creates 7 accounts on the first day of its operation (Accounts) with random users, in the getRandomOwners method returns 1-3 random Clients after checking that none of them has been selected second duplicate, also when you call to create a new account there is a chance: 40% SimpleCreditAccount, 40% SuperCreditAccount and 20% deadline (ReserveAccount). In the simulation every day they are performed from 1-3 Transactions, each of these transactions has a probability: 15% new opening account (openAccount), 40% deposit, 40% withdraw, 5% closing account (closeAccount) and at the end of each day you become the payInterest where  it is needed and the closed accounts are transferred to the folder that follows it route: .. \ BANK_FILES \ Bank_Database \ Accounts. Closed.
All of the above percentages are assumed to be without loss of generality. 

In restore mode, the files from the previous executions are recovered and given special emphasis on maintaining the correct IBAN (change of static field based on the latter IBAN of the last execution). Finally, after any operation, the rest and all files are updated, which Specifically, Details.txt, Account.bin are rewritten and we write at the end of xxxxxx.txt and xxxxxx.bin (where xxxxxx is the IBAN number of each account) where the transactions are. You achieve this by invoking the update (by definition it) in the methods of the functions copy -clone of the current account).
